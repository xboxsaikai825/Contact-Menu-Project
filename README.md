# Contact Menu Project

This program saves and loads contacts from a csv file. It can create, modify and edit any contact.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** C++

The program was implemented through classes and inheritence, where the menu and linked list were derived to fit the needs of the project. Contacts are saved onto a csv file where the program can later read and fill the link list with contacts.

## Lessons Learned:

Using a linked list instead of an array or vector was a challenging, but it taught me how linked lists work and how to implement them into a program. I learned more about inheritance and how useful it can be to fit the needs of any program, such as deriving the linked list class to create functions for the contact menu.
